Jeddit: An AppEngine Example
============================

This is a simple reddit clone made to demonstrate some core concepts of Google App Engine

To deploy this app, check out the source code and edit app.yaml, change the "application" to your application name
which you can create in the [Google Cloud Dashboard](https://cloud.google.com/console#/project) then download
the [App Engine SDK](https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Python) and run

      appcfg.py update path/to/jeddit

You should then be able to access the Application at "your-project-name.appspot.com"
